 ## How to Import the Repo into Databricks?

1. You first need to add Git credentials to Databricks. Refer to [documentation here](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/repos-setup.html#add-git-credentials-to-databricks).  

2. Click `Repos` in the sidebar. Click `Add Repo` on the top right.

3. Clone the "HTTPS" URL from GitHub, or copy `https://github.com/databricks-academy/large-language-models.git` and paste into the box `Git repository URL`. The rest of the fields, i.e. `Git provider` and `Repository name`, will be automatically populated. Click `Create Repo` on the bottom right.

 ## How to Import the files from `.dbc` releases on GitHub
1. You can download the notebooks from a release by navigating to the releases section on the GitHub page:
 
    <img width="400" alt="dbc_release1" src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/llm/dbc_release1.png">
 
2. From the releases page, download the `.dbc` file. This contains all of the course notebooks, with the structure and meta data.

3. In your Databricks workspace, navigate to the Workspace menu, click on Home and select `Import`:

4. Using the import tool, navigate to the location on your computer where the `.dbc` file was dowloaded from Step 1. Once you select the file, click `Import`, and the files will be loaded and extracted to your workspace:

## Which Databricks cluster should I use? 

1. First, select `Single Node`

2. This courseware has been tested on [Databricks Runtime 13.1 for Machine Learning]([url](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/13.1ml.html)). If you do not have access to a 13.1 ML Runtime cluster, you will need to install many additional libraries (as the ML Runtime pre-installs many commonly used machine learning packages), and this courseware is not guaranteed to run.

    For all of the notebooks except `LLM 04a - Fine-tuning LLMs` and `LLM04L - Fine-tuning LLMs Lab`, you can run them on a CPU just fine. We recommend either `i3.xlarge` or `i3.2xlarge` (i3.2xlarge will have slightly faster performance).

    For these notebooks: `LLM 04a - Fine-tuning LLMs` and `LLM04L - Fine-tuning LLMs Lab`, you will need the Databricks Runtime 13.1 for Machine Learning **with GPU**. 

    <img width="400" alt="gpu" src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/llm/gpu.png">

    
    Select GPU instance type of `g5.2xlarge`.

 <summary> Install datasets and models </summary>
 
## How do I install the datasets and models locally?
 
1. To improve performance of the code, we highly recommend pre-installing the datasets and models by running the `LLM 00a - Install Datasets` notebook. </br>
    <img width="400" alt="install_datasets_file" src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/llm/installdatasets1.png">

2. You should run this script before running any of the other notebooks. This can take up to 25mins to complete.
